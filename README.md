# Success criteria definitions

## Overview

The web app team projects are almost independent projects; you define everything about it: the topic, the goals, the outcomes & how to grade yourself.

*Before we start to really dig into everything you need to set your expectations for the outcomes & grades.*

---

## Details

Determine all the goals that your project needs to meet—and write them all down.

**You’ll need 2 sets of goals:**

1. Set of goals & a rubric for the UX
2. Set of goals & a rubric for code

Ask yourselves lots of different questions to try to determine each goal. **And within that goal what would be considered bad & good?**

### What is important to your team?

- Good teamwork?
- Strict convention following?
- Ability to multitask?
- Ability to fill many roles?
- Good leadership?
- Cohesion?
- Good sprint planning & execution?
- *etc.*

### How will your team determine success?

- Meets goals?
- Quality personas?
- Lots of research?
- Good presentation?
- Good results in testing?
- Well produce wireframes?
- Well produced prototype?
- Ease of use?
- Adherence to design best practices?
- Catchy design?
- Responsiveness?
- Accessibility?
- Performance?
- Code quality?
- Commit quality?
- Code deduplication & maintainability?
- Validation?
- Critiques from peers?
- *etc.*

### How will you determine & grade quality?

- What defines a good persona vs. a bad persona?
- What defines quality research vs. poor research?
- What defines ease of use vs. poor usability?
- What defines quality responsiveness vs. not responsive?
- What defines accessible vs. inaccessible?
- *etc.*

## Goal

Create 2 rubrics as GitHub Issues attached to your `web-app` repository. Label both Issues with the “product” label.

1. A rubric defining your success criteria for the UX component
2. A rubric defining your success criteria for the coded app component

### Example Markdown rubric code

Here’s the table generating code you’d need to put into a GitHub Issue to generate a visible rubric table.

```md
| | 0 points | 1 points | 2 points | 3 points |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Accessibility** | No considerations | Added some alt attributes, nothing else | Just the basics: alt attributes, roles | Accessibility is well considered and tested |
| **Code quality** | Barely started | Indentation is barely existent, lots of validation errors, very poor semantics | Decent indentation, just a couple validation errors, decent semantics | Well indented, fully valid, good semantics |
```

- Change the point values
- Add as many lines as are necessary
- Add the titles & different descriptions

*We’re following an Agile approach, so the rubrics can be massaged over time.* **But don’t just delete rows because you were unsuccessful at the goal—own up to your failure.** Honesty is better.

## Hand in

Show the teacher both completed rubrics for marks.
